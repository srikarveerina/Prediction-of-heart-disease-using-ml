# Prediction-of-heart-disease-using-ml
# Here we used machine learning through Python
Description: The goal of this project was to predict the presence of heart disease in patients where this presence is valued
from no presence to likely presence. In this project, we   proposed   a vertical system integration
of a sensor node and toolkit of machine learning algorithm for predicting the heart disease of a person. 
The dataset for this project is automatically taken from the raw value of the heart pulse sensor and it also used
some manually given data. With this project, we have shown that the raw data from the sensor actually increases the accuracy of the model.
By using the machine learning algorithms on the given data set we can tell whether they has heart disease or not.
